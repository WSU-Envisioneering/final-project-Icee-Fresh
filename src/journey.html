        During my time in WEB 1400, I learned how to structure a webpage using HTML and apply various styles using CSS. One of the biggest highlights for me was finally understanding how a basic web page comes to life â€” from elements like headings and paragraphs, to linking pages and adding images. It felt like unlocking a new language. I also learned about powerful layout tools such as Flexbox and Grid, which allow for precise positioning and responsive design. At first, I found them a bit confusing â€” especially when trying to make layouts work across different screen sizes. ðŸ˜… Flexbox in particular felt tricky to wrap my head around, but I know that with more practice, Iâ€™ll get the hang of it.

        What really helped me succeed in this course were the mentors and classmates around me. Whenever I felt stuck, there was always someone willing to lend a hand, explain a concept, or show me what I might be missing. Having that support system made a big difference and helped me stay motivated, even when the material got challenging. The course itself was well-structured and gave me plenty of chances to practice what I was learning. Honestly, the biggest challenge wasnâ€™t the course â€” it was just my own learning curve with styling layouts. But thatâ€™s okay! I'm proud of how far Iâ€™ve come, and Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and improving. I know that every mistake I make is just another step forward in my journey to becoming a better web developer.
